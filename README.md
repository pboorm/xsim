# xsim
X-ray Simulator - A streamlit app to simulate different X-ray spectral models

## Interactive spectral generation
By selecting stock spectral models, or uploading a .xcm file, the user can create a model. This model is then rendered by xsim into an interactive plot used to view the different components, and tweak the parameters in real-time.

## Usage
Run
```console
streamlit run app.py
```
